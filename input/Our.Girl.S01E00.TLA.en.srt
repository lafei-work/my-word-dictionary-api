1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,167
Tonight, our special coverage...

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,339
for a closer look of the daily
lives of people in the region.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,639
We'll be looking at the
war against extremism

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,290
waged by British and American troops

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,510
over the border of Afghanistan...

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,900
A new study says more and more
white British people are...

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,359
... lives lost and the
fact that Barack Obama

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,079
is about to pour thousands
more troops into this region.

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,309
It is by no means certain we will prevail.

10
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,739
What we do know, from bitter experience,

11
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,339
is that, whatever
happens here, good or bad,

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,840
the rest of the world
will feel the consequences.

13
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,389
Happy birthday, Molly!

14
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,589
My little girl's all grown up!

15
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,309
Still very immature though, Mum.

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,229
- Don't forget that!
- Fluffy scrambled eggs, coming up!

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,549
- What times he getting here?
- Don't know.

18
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,020
Oh, God, look at the state of you, Dave!

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,029
Uh, Dad, I ain't being
funny, but you stink.

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,349
You been fighting again?

21
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,509
- He had a ruck with the door, didn't ya?
- She slammed it on my face, the door.

22
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,949
Slammed. Bosh. Unkind. Thought
she'd done me schnoz in.

23
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,749
Yeah, you crack on enjoying
yourself, you piss-taker.

24
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,669
I think those frozen fish
fingers saved the day.

25
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,109
There are a lot of sacrifices
went into that present!

26
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,610
Make up for me getting a
bit involved last night, eh?

27
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,640
Dad, that's proper.

28
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,702
Oh, thanks, Dad!

29
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,860
Did you ever doubt me?

30
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,069
Here, don't let that pikey
boyfriend of yours see it.

31
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,309
- He'll have it.
- Don't spoil the moment, Dad.

32
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,629
♪ And then I go and spoil it all ♪

33
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,429
♪ By saying something stupid... ♪

34
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,309
He needs to hurry up.

35
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,589
His eggs are ready.

36
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,310
Oh, get off, Dave. You do stink.

37
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,669
Just be careful, yeah?

38
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,269
You won't say nothing to
Dad, right? Yeah? Right?

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,703
All right.

40
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,860
- Oh!
- Yeah!

41
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,989
Oi! You look after her,
Dean, d'you hear me?

42
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,469
What d'you think? Of course!

43
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,349
If you don't, I will spoon your eyes out.

44
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,569
You was up to a lot
worst than me at my age.

45
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,090
See you later.

46
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,389
Thought you was coming
round mine this morning.

47
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,589
I am coming. I'm coming in a moment.

48
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,269
- Bit late, then, yeah?
- I was just coming round with your present.

49
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,069
You wasn't. You was standing there
talking to that pikey knobber.

50
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,949
I didn't think you were
going to work today.

51
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,869
I think you might be staying in bed.

52
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,970
I was trying to be kind.

53
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,339
Molly.

54
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,520
I've got you a present.

55
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,109
What do you think?

56
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,949
It ain't an engagement ring, is it?

57
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,950
Maybe.

58
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,665
You like?

59
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,810
Walk me to work, then.

60
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,389
- Who give you this?
- Nice, innit?

61
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,300
- Who?
- It's Tiffany, mate!

62
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,069
- It's not Tiffany.
- What do you know about anything?

63
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,298
It's snide.

64
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,949
Oh, right, so you're the
expert on everything now, yeah?

65
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,189
My brother sells snide
jewellery on the internet.

66
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,182
Well, your brothers a tosser, then!

67
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,389
Tonight, I take you for a curry.

68
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,029
You English love your curry.

69
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,660
No, I'm busy, mate.

70
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,430
You love me.

71
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,260
Not as much as you love yourself.

72
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,979
Stop it.

73
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,970
See you later.

74
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,709
If it's ten pound to get in,
and drinks cost a fortune,

75
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,549
we just make sure we get trollied
before we get in there, of course!

76
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,189
I'll do some cocktails in my flask.

77
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,190
What?

78
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,069
We're not taking your flask
into a club again, Mum!

79
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,549
They thought you'd come
with a cup of tea last time!

80
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,069
They were very nice
cocktails though, Mrs. Vale.

81
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,469
Look, tin of Red Bull,
yeah, pour half away,

82
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,429
fill the rest up with vodka.

83
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,869
That is me sorted.

84
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,385
These nails are digging in tonight! Grrrr!

85
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,080
- Well, that's 40 for you and your mum, Shaz.
- Thank you.

86
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,989
Ta. What you wearing tonight?

87
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,629
I'm going to wear, you know the,
erm, the black... the black dress

88
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,509
- with the er...
- Small varnish, please, love.

89
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,760
- Not today, Dad.
- Yes, today!

90
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,160
Change for me 20.

91
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,102
He's such a tool.

92
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,749
- I dunno what's the matter with you half the time!
- You!

93
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,149
Pass us the eyeliner, Mar.

94
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,549
You're what's the matter
with me all of the time, mate!

95
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,589
No wonder I have to get
out, with you going on!

96
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,349
And you're not having our food
money to pour down your fat gullet,

97
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,669
and that's that.

98
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,989
I've just give her my housekeeping money.

99
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,360
You give your rent money
to me, not her. Understood?

100
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,749
See you later, Mum!

101
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,829
- Have a great time tonight, Molls.
- I'll have a go!

102
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,365
- You be careful!
- Don't worry about that,

103
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:26,300
I got Proud Mary to protect me, eh, Mar?

104
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,589
Yeah. Unless I get too
rotten on it and collapse.

105
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,789
Then, it's just every man for herself.

106
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,109
- Here you go.
- What's that for?!

107
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,469
Well, I don't want any
housekeeping from you this week.

108
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,149
I want you to enjoy your birthday.

109
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,229
- Not a breath to your dad.
- Oh, yeah, as if!

110
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,549
And don't let him tap you up
for any either, Proud Mary.

111
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,580
Why is he so crap, Mum?

112
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,589
Why ain't you wearing your bracelet?

113
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,149
Erm... I didn't want to lose it.

114
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,629
It's bound to get messy, isn't it?

115
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,989
You do like it, though, yeah?

116
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,709
Yeah, love it! Did you get it?

117
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,189
Yeah, well, Dad went and got
it, but I gave him the money.

118
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,364
Been saving family allowance.

119
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:59,121
- You be careful, yeah?
- All right.

120
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,429
Just give it back to him.
Stop eating that! Give it back!

121
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,470
Well, I'll have it, then!

122
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,709
There's always more of them on a Friday.

123
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,269
All they gotta do is
go Friday night prayer,

124
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,709
they get their sins of
the week just wiped off.

125
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,560
I can see why it's so popular now.

126
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,330
He's come to meet you! Sweet.

127
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,062
- Hi.
- What's going on?

128
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,589
I thought you were going to pub!

129
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,949
Who's that mess?

130
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,109
Why you saying this? Molly,
it's not what you think.

131
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,389
No, it never is, is it?

132
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,029
You, you dirty slag, get out of the car!

133
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,669
Come on! Get out of the car, you
need to be taught some manners,

134
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,949
you dirty cow, get out!

135
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,386
Hey! What's the matter with you?

136
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,142
Dirty slag!

137
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,709
You go like a mental!

138
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,680
Be warned, I am mental!

139
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,309
Right, that is it, he has
shit on me for the last time.

140
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,744
- Cheers!
- Yes!

141
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,625
Hey! That was us once.

142
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,709
Right, go on, then, down it.

143
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,949
Down it. Yeah, down it! Down it. Down it.

144
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,572
- Hey, they still want you off the sick?
- Yeah.

145
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:34,573
Even with your back?

146
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,069
I never voted for this mob.

147
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,180
Who'd you vote for, then?

148
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,666
Down it! Down it!

149
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,800
Mum! It's so embarrassing!

150
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,069
She was my cousin. Just my cousin.

151
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,229
- Is that the best you can do?
- What?

152
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,349
After all them hours
and she's your cousin?!

153
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,387
- She is my cousin.
- Yeah, right!

154
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,469
You don't want to be my
girlfriend, I have my ring back.

155
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,920
Here are. Hope it chokes you.

156
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,549
I want you to be my girlfriend.

157
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,149
- So what was the dippy-blurt in the van all about, then?!
- I told you!

158
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,189
She didn't look Albanian!

159
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,749
What do we look like?

160
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,062
You got funny-shaped
heads and spazzer jeans.

161
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,269
She arrive today. Doesn't
speak a word of English.

162
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,580
I am only person she knows.

163
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,629
I trying to help her get
away from very bad people.

164
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,507
She my cousin.

165
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,105
You... my girlfriend.

166
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,146
You Albanian freak!

167
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,469
My head isn't a funny shape.

168
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,029
You're joking, mate?! You got
head like a Sainsbury's till!

169
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,030
Till-Head, that's what we call you.

170
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,030
Belinda!

171
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,899
Belinda!

172
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,425
Belinda!

173
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,185
Belinda!

174
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,829
Look at our country, Belinda!

175
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,105
Gone to shit, mate.

176
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,310
Our beautiful East London.

177
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,749
Been ethnically cleansed.

178
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,810
So us whites, we've been driven out,

179
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,789
but no-one cares about us! No, no.

180
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,543
Were not worth caring about.

181
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,120
Were the wrong colour, that's our trouble!

182
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,469
What's the matter with you?

183
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,789
What? Don't I get a civil hello?

184
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,749
- Don't wake the kids up.
- I've had enough of you!

185
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,229
- Well, what did you come home for, then?!
- Cos it's my house! Mine!

186
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,309
Actually, it's The London Borough
of Newham's, but there you go!

187
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,187
Thanks. Cheers.

188
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,749
Is that you, Mar?

189
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,025
Yeah?

190
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,429
Oh, oh, hi, Moll. You all right?

191
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,000
- Having a good night?
- Yeah, wicked. Pass us a fag, Mar.

192
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,549
Oh, ta!

193
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,709
I'll see you at the table.

194
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,789
There you are!

195
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,050
Just been looking for you.

196
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,290
I'm just going for that fag.

197
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,229
Hey! Hey, darling! What's going on, babe?

198
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,149
Looking good. Do you want
to come to a party with us?

199
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,510
- Yeah, I'll come to a party.
- Right, jump in the back.

200
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,379
Oi!

201
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,189
Oi! Don't you want to fuck me?

202
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,430
Oh, for fuck's sake.

203
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,349
Shh. Go to sleep. It's Saturday.

204
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,783
Where you going?

205
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,389
Brush my teeth. I honk.

206
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,050
- Love you.
- I'm glad someone does.

207
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,824
Love you.

208
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,383
Oh...

209
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,581
Smells nice.

210
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,707
I hope you're changing them sheets.

211
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,509
What d'you get up to? Anything nice?

212
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,545
Club.

213
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,869
Might take you clubbing.

214
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,189
- What?
- Nothing.

215
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,189
See Artan last night?

216
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,989
Perry, right, proper chippy.

217
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,709
He can't get any work cos the
Poles'll build you a frigging house

218
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,029
for the price of a cup of tea.

219
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,989
- Ain't worth his while getting out of bed.
- Artan's Albanian.

220
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,469
You know what I'm taking about.

221
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,669
I'm talking about the
destruction of England.

222
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,626
What did he get you?

223
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,500
That ain't an engagement ring?

224
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,850
Don't worry, you two have
put me off marriage for life.

225
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:46,949
Yeah, don't let your gob run
away or I'll shut it for you!

226
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,709
- Yeah, try it and I'll stab you.
- Molly!

227
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,269
You'll do what you're told
or you live on the streets!

228
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,989
You think you're someone special,
don't you? Well, you're not.

229
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,980
You're just a run-of-the-mill slag.

230
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,189
- I done this?
- Yeah, it's shit, isn't it?

231
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,549
- I could turn it into daisies or something?
- I don't care,

232
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,869
just get rid of the Artan.

233
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,019
Definitely be better with
daisies than just blocking it out.

234
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
Whatever.

235
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,460
Does it hurt?

236
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,789
- What you looking at?
- Dunno, lost me zoo book.

237
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,382
Ha, bloody ha.

238
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,028
- You local?
- Yeah.

239
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,789
Last white woman on Kath-rhine Road.

240
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,429
Fancy an job in the Army, then?

241
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:22,230
Great job that... £100 a week to
have my head used as target practice.

242
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,470
Got any leaflets then?

243
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,269
I'm only tentative. I'm just
checking out the options.

244
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,550
Why don't you take a seat
and we can have a chat?

245
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,427
Don't be nervous.

246
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,189
We don't just throw you
onto the back of a truck.

247
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,669
We only want soldiers
who want to be soldiers.

248
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,189
I didn't think you'd want
the likes of me joining up.

249
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,560
Take these home and have
a butchers at your leisure.

250
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,590
- How old are you?
- 18.

251
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,469
What d'you have to do, then?

252
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,549
Well, first, you have to do the BARB test.

253
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,189
Just a short test you
can do on the computer.

254
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,869
Someone of your intelligence,
it'll be a piece of cake.

255
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,389
- Me?! I'm stupid.
- I don't think so.

256
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,829
Well, you don't know me.
I'm famous for being stupid.

257
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,429
Well, we can do the BARB
test now, if you like.

258
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,549
Find out just how stupid you are.

259
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,749
What and I just do it on the computer?

260
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,069
Exactly. Touch screen.

261
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,549
Then we throw you on a lorry and
you'll be in Helmand by tea time.

262
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,350
I'll probably fail the test anyway.

263
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,590
So...

264
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,980
Do you want to do it now?

265
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,790
All right.

266
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,944
Let's do it! Oh!

267
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,109
What you looking at?

268
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,069
Dunno, lost me zoo book.

269
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,829
- Get a job.
- I'm sick!

270
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,390
Yeah, in the head.

271
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,469
Mum, I'm going down Sara
Banajee's for a couple of days.

272
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,229
- Who?
- She got into college in Brighton, remember?

273
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,469
They said at primary school that
you were University material.

274
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,509
- Did they?
- Mind you, you were the only one

275
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,029
who could speak bleeding English.

276
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,300
- Is Artan going with you?
- No, he ain't.

277
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,789
- Can you try and be nice to Dad?
- Why?

278
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,730
Because he wasn't always a dickhead.

279
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,869
Right, left! Right, left!

280
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,383
Turn!

281
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,469
Ladies and gentlemen, if I can have
your attention for a moment, please.

282
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,619
OK.

283
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,429
All right, these next two
days are very important

284
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,949
if you want to progress
in the British Army.

285
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,309
So take every task seriously
and try your best, all right?

286
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,029
For some of you, this is going
to be the end of the line.

287
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,589
For others, you'll be invited
to go on to the next stage,

288
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,469
which is Phase One, Basic Training.

289
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,585
OK.

290
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,509
You know you're all here to have
your medicals, but before you go in

291
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,025
and see the doctor for your examination,

292
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,355
- you'll have a few different tests first.
- Oh!

293
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,381
Problem with that, 17?

294
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,320
No, it's just a bit boring so far.

295
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,669
So that was your sit-ups.

296
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,589
The Technical Selection Test
is basically a mathematics test.

297
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,509
You've then got your undergrasp heave test.

298
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,659
55 questions.

299
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,269
Powerbag lift and rope climb.

300
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,949
Should take you about half an hour.

301
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,189
Every applicant must take
these upper-body strength tests.

302
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,225
On you go.

303
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,103
Oi!

304
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,829
Did you fucking "oi" me?!

305
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,150
My hand slipped, that's all.

306
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,026
God, I'm knackered.

307
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,110
You?

308
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,749
My hands still hurt from them jerry cans!

309
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,949
You were good.

310
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,029
I have to bring our
shopping home from Iceland.

311
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,190
- Are you from London?
- Could you tell?

312
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,350
- How about you?
- Do you know Preston?

313
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,829
- Lancashire.
- So Preston's your town, yeah?

314
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,469
Well, no, Leyland. But I didn't
think you'd have heard of that,

315
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,349
- but it's just outside of Preston.
- Which I also hadn't heard of.

316
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:42,040
- Yeah, but you know where Lancashire is though, right?
- Yeah, obviously.

317
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,269
Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

318
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,869
Welcome to this part of your
selection known as The Icebreaker.

319
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,509
Each and every one of you will
be coming up here, individually,

320
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,469
and telling us a little
bit about yourselves.

321
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,150
Who's going to be brave enough to go first?

322
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,739
Uh?

323
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,869
OK. I hear you've got a
lot to say for yourself.

324
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,389
Who told you that?

325
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,539
Get up here.

326
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,229
You never stop fucking chuntering on.

327
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:30,270
Now, come on, now's your chance,
cos we all want to listen.

328
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,630
Good.

329
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,749
Up here.

330
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,109
Where you going?

331
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,549
I don't want to stand up and talk.

332
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,909
Fair play. The army's not for
everyone. Leave now, though,

333
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,669
- and you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
- You reckon?

334
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,944
I know.

335
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,949
See, I had you down as a trier, eh.

336
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,909
I thought you'd be brave enough to
come up here and talk for a while.

337
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,389
You don't think I'm going
to make the grade anyhow!

338
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,269
I can see you all looking down
your big, shiny schnozes at me.

339
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,465
Don't be so fucking wet.

340
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,229
Turn around and talk to the class

341
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,549
or have everyone know
what a lettuce you are.

342
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,144
A lettuce? Loser.

343
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:18,900
Couldn't do it when it matters,
eh? You want that on your headstone?

344
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,230
Let's see if you've got what it takes.

345
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,840
My names Molly Dawes.

346
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,709
I come from near Stratford, not
the one that Shakespeare comes from,

347
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,828
the other one in the
London Borough of Newham,

348
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:10,109
which sometimes I think is the
nicest place on the planet to live

349
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,990
and other times I think
is a right shit-hole.

350
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,780
Don't look at me again. Get on.

351
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:27,629
Sometimes, I walk down East
Ham High Street in the sun

352
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,000
and smell the spices, and
see every manner of people

353
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,701
and I well up.

354
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,989
I feel really proud of where I come from.

355
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,778
And, other times, when
it's all powder keggy

356
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,950
and like it's about to
blow, I just want to run.

357
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,790
Just want to run away and
live in a barn somewhere.

358
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,189
I live off the Portway with my
three sisters, my two brothers,

359
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,545
my pregnant mum

360
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,730
and my tosspot of a dad.

361
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,069
All crammed into this little Lego house

362
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,302
that's bursting at the
seams with noise and toys

363
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,188
and cheap Polish lager,

364
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,589
kids scooters, piles and piles of washing

365
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,549
that my mum keeps meaning to do,
but she's always too knackered

366
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:26,370
cos my dad's enough to
knacker any bugger out.

367
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,900
He's at home all day on the sick,

368
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,389
cos when he was a Sky dish fitter,

369
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,829
some toerag had it away with his ladder

370
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,910
and he fell off this
roof and landed in a bush.

371
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,840
Done his back in.

372
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,140
He went to hospital.

373
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:51,149
He had to shit in a pan for weeks
cos he couldn't get out of bed.

374
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,780
Lost his job and...

375
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,090
... then, he got the
depression, my mum reckons.

376
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,699
Some days, he's as right as a ninepence,

377
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:09,060
and other days, I see him hobbling
around, moaning and groaning,

378
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,800
like a 90-year-old.

379
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,829
Then, a mate lends him a tenner
and it's a bleeding miracle,

380
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,189
he can shuffle down the pub
and get a pint down his Gregory,

381
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,669
which, of course, he
says is a muscle relaxant

382
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,189
and if it wasn't for his back, then
he wouldn't bother with the drinking.

383
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:42,469
But sometimes, I can see it
all mapped out in front of me.

384
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,230
My shitty little life
just waiting to happen.

385
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:53,069
Middle-aged me, picking up toys

386
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,347
and cans of lager,

387
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:01,620
as my tosspot boyfriend pisses
on any dreams I might have had.

388
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,389
The one-and-a-half-mile
run is an important test.

389
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,309
Pass and you'll remain on selection,

390
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,149
fail and you may as well go home.

391
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,629
Once you've completed your
run, go back to your quarters

392
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,269
and get ready for your interview.

393
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,909
You will then be told whether
you'll be recommended for enlistment.

394
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,229
Right, then, good luck, everybody.

395
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,028
On your marks, go!

396
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,629
You all right, Katy? Katy?

397
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,858
My ankle!

398
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,747
What are you doing?

399
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,120
She's fell over!

400
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,069
I can see that. Leave her and move on!

401
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,152
- Come on Katy, get up!
- I can't!

402
00:29:59,153 --> 00:30:00,153
I said leave her!

403
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,389
What the fuck is this? Two
Little Boys?! Leave her.

404
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,880
That is an order!

405
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,618
How is it?

406
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,469
Oh, it's all right. Bit better.

407
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,229
I did a timed run before the
selection, so the Corporal reckons

408
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,429
they might be able to take
that into consideration.

409
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,749
Well, I'm screwed, then.

410
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,200
You should have just left me.

411
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,869
Anyway, I think I might have made a
bit of a ricket on the clothes front.

412
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,989
Here, have you got any other shoes?

413
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,629
- Only me trainers.
- What size are you?

414
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,222
Five and a half.

415
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:39,229
I got a pair of sixes. There you go.

416
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,669
And what about leggings?
Have you got any of them?

417
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,669
Cos your skirt might be a bit short.

418
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,309
I ain't got any leggings.

419
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,743
Here.

420
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,582
Take them.

421
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,730
Go in there and fight for your life.

422
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,229
I've got all the comments
of the various NCOs

423
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,509
and, in fact, everybody who's been involved

424
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,109
in this two-day selection process.

425
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,145
Yes, sir.

426
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,744
Ma'am.

427
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,069
We have to make sure any
potential recruit has a 90% chance

428
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,389
of making it through Phase One Training.

429
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,505
Yes, Ma'am.

430
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,330
You want to join the Royal
Army Medical Corps, I see?

431
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,589
You didn't make you cap badge time
for your one-and-a-half-mile run.

432
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,989
I need more training.

433
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:35,400
I understand you stopped to assist
another recruit who had fallen.

434
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,390
You have divided opinion, Miss Dawes.

435
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,309
You tell me why I should recommend you.

436
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,549
Tell me why the British Army should
have you swelling their ranks,

437
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:53,309
and I don't want to hear, I
want this more than anything.

438
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,584
Truth?

439
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,309
I reckon if I really,
really tried my hardest,

440
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,269
then, I wouldn't be the worst.

441
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,869
And do we want someone who
aspires to be not the worst?

442
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,789
We need soldiers who aspire to be the best.

443
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,389
Just give me a chance.

444
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,709
And why should I do that?

445
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,960
Because I've never had one.

446
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:18,870
And if I'm given a chance, I wont
let anyone down, I swear, Miss.

447
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,260
A couple of the comments
are extremely heartening.

448
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,549
You clearly have attributes
that you're either unaware of

449
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,789
or too modest to promote.

450
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,960
- Thanks.
- I'm not sure it's a compliment, Miss Dawes.

451
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,938
So...

452
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,980
... do I really think you're worth it?

453
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,789
To be honest, I just wanted to talk
to you, like, outside the house.

454
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,508
Away from the noise.

455
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,789
Well, if it helps you out, we know.

456
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,450
- Yeah, and we don't mind.
- Really?

457
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,509
Well, you're our daughter,
Moll. We love you.

458
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,829
You're not a little girl any
more, so fair play to you.

459
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,670
And it's your decision.

460
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,389
I thought you wouldn't approve.

461
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,789
Well, I think he's a bit of
a tool, but it's your choice.

462
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,189
Well, to be fair, we hardly know him, Dave.

463
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,549
Who are you talking about?

464
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,222
Artan.

465
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,829
What's it gotta do with him?

466
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,620
Well, he is the father, isn't he?

467
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,069
Oh, it's not that mongy nut
bar from Islington, is it?

468
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,629
I ain't pregnant! Did
you think I was pregnant?

469
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,700
No!

470
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:56,789
Well... what was you going to say, then?

471
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,064
When?!

472
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,980
Bloody taking us for
this nosh and everything.

473
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm joining the Army.

474
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,170
You're fucking joking?

475
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,629
- I'm Muslim, Molly!
- What's that got to do with anything?

476
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,109
What do you think!? That's
what your Army's for...

477
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,429
to kill Muslims.

478
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,989
Oh, that's pathetic.

479
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,109
What about us, uh!? How
long is this training?

480
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,792
It's 14 weeks, Artan.

481
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,872
14 weeks! And it might be
nice if one bloody person

482
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:26,927
just said "Oh, well done, Mol, good for you."

483
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,069
Instead of you moaning
and my mum and dad worrying

484
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,509
about who's going to pick
the kids up from school!

485
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,869
You only care about yourself!

486
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,640
You're a selfish, stupid,
fucking little girl!

487
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,429
You join the Army...

488
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,022
And what? What?!

489
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,029
What you going to do? You going to kill me?

490
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,309
I want to marry you!

491
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,509
Even though I kill Muslims?

492
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,749
- I love you.
- You sure about that?

493
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:52,389
Cos your old chap seemed quite keen
on Proud Mary last time I looked!

494
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,189
"I, Molly Dawes, swear by Almighty God

495
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,109
that I will be faithful
and bear true allegiance

496
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:02,069
to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
II, her heirs and successors

497
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,709
and that I will, as in duty bound,

498
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:09,989
honestly and faithfully defend Her
Majesty, her heirs and successors,

499
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,960
in person, crown and
dignity against all enemies

500
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,869
and will observe and obey
all orders of Her Majesty,

501
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,469
her heirs and successors

502
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,290
and of the generals and
officers set over me."

503
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,070
Right. That's one Queen's
shilling we owe you.

504
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,589
Half a day's pay now.
That's inflation for you.

505
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,590
Sir.

506
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:39,149
Don't think being a combat medical
technician is some easy option, Miss Dawes.

507
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,029
Don't think you're going to be
floating around the corridors

508
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:46,469
of some well-equipped field
hospital like Florence Nightingale.

509
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,909
You'll be in some godforsaken shit-hole

510
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,269
trying to tie a tourniquet
on some poor bastard

511
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,789
who's just had both of his legs blown off.

512
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,508
Sir, yes, sir.

513
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,549
Yes. A simple "yes, sir" will suffice.

514
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,109
Were not American...

515
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,179
yet.

516
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,469
Ah, good, might get my leggings back!

517
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,430
Feels a bit more serious
this time, doesn't it?

518
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,819
Two Section, line! Now!

519
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,189
My name is Corporal Geddings.

520
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:26,900
For the next 14 weeks,
I am your mother, father,

521
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:32,542
boyfriend, grandma and your
bloody God all rolled into one.

522
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,780
You are mine.

523
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,225
More importantly,

524
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,345
I am yours.

525
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:46,150
I will do my best to make sure each
and every one of you make the grade.

526
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,829
I say something funny, Dawes?

527
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,229
No, sir.

528
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,509
Don't call me sir.

529
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,820
I work for a bloody living.

530
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,149
So what's funny?

531
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,509
Nothing, Corporal.

532
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,229
Then, why the fucking grin?!

533
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,510
It just felt I was in a
film for a minute, sorry.

534
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,389
Some of you look a mess.

535
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,346
Puffy and pudgy,

536
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,580
big bags under your eyes.

537
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,669
This isn't the fucking Priory.
Are you listening, Dawes?

538
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,610
Yeah. This isn't the fucking Priory.

539
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,985
14 bloody weeks.

540
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,789
That's all I've got to make
soldiers out of you lot.

541
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:40,710
Some recruits don't have it
in them to complete the course.

542
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,509
It isn't easy being a
soldier in the British Army.

543
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,530
We've got to separate
the wheat from the chaff.

544
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,989
You understand what I mean
by wheat and chaff, King?

545
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,560
Not sure, Corporal.

546
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:02,341
We've got to separate
the shit from the clay.

547
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,940
I only want clay on my hands.

548
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,160
The PlayStation generation!

549
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,790
Can you hear that noise?

550
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:22,229
That's the fucking Taliban,
shitting themselves!

551
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,469
These next few weeks are going to need

552
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,989
your absolute concentration and dedication.

553
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,426
Those determined enough will pass out.

554
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,109
Those that dig deeper than
they ever thought they could

555
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,949
and find new strengths will pass through.

556
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:40,629
Those that do not give up in the
face of adversity will do all right.

557
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,746
I promise you that.

558
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,902
You want it enough, you will get it.

559
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,380
Those that aren't 100% focused...

560
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,343
... will fail.

561
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,589
I promise you that as well.

562
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,859
Right, left!

563
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,930
Right left, right, left.

564
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:28,189
Will you lot kindly remember
that you are now soldiers!

565
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,181
Oi, you!

566
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,147
Dyed blond hair!

567
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,989
Do not drag your kit along the ground!

568
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,140
Pick it up now!

569
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,470
Move it, move it! Move it!

570
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,383
Oh, Jesus wept!

571
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:45,349
What's the matter with
you? Is it too heavy?

572
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,669
Shall I do it for you?
Pick it up and move it! Now!

573
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:52,949
Your kit is your responsibility.
I want it immaculate at all times.

574
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,340
I want it ironed and your boots bulled.

575
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,349
You brought plenty of polish, Dawes?

576
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,988
Yes, Corporal.

577
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:03,469
And your locker has
gotta be like your minds.

578
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,189
What do I mean by that, Dawes?

579
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,703
Dirty?

580
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,949
Everything in its rightful place.

581
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,622
Everything 100%.

582
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,270
- Ordered. Organised.
- Why?

583
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,109
If your lockers not spot on,
I'll know nothings spot on.

584
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,669
Fail at keeping your locker tidy,

585
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,909
you'll fail at everything
here at Pirbright.

586
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,989
And we don't want that, do we, Dawes?

587
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,789
I'm not here to wipe your arse,
I'm here to point at your arse

588
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,389
and tell you to get the bloody thing wiped.

589
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,469
And by week two, I don't
even want to be pointing,

590
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,109
I shall expect you to know and
to have done it yourself already.

591
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,550
I shall walk in here at 0600

592
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,389
and I shall inspect
your locker and your kit

593
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,349
and if there's so much
as a crease out of place,

594
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,749
you'll have to do it again.

595
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,980
And again and again.

596
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,502
Right, I'll be back in five minutes

597
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,589
and I want to see you all
in your uniforms, please.

598
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,589
And maybe someone should
step up to the plate

599
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,860
and have a word with your class clown.

600
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,746
Jump! Go on!

601
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,629
Jump! Hurry up! Come on!

602
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,429
Don't wait! Don't hesitate! Straight over!

603
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,709
What are you hesitating for? Straight over!

604
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,349
Run! Don't wait, just push it over!

605
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,629
Come on! Hurry up and get over that wall!

606
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,949
What are you doing, Dawes?!

607
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,429
Don't fucking start!

608
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,629
You want special treatment, do you?!

609
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,709
Maybe we could write to the Al-Qaeda
and say you don't take bullets.

610
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,149
- Shall we do that?
- I have yet to see a gallant bullet,

611
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,189
that carefully avoids members of
the female sex and targets only men.

612
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,149
Come on! Dig in! Give it your best!

613
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,549
- Are you giving it your best, Dawes?
- I don't think you are.

614
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,789
- Come on, push yourself.
- Find the courage to do this!

615
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,749
- Only you can find the balls!
- Two weeks here, you've got worse!

616
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:12,480
- Don't be a waste of space! Run!
- Come on, Dawes, find it!

617
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,190
Rise up!

618
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,949
Don't get too comfy yet, ladies.

619
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,542
Locker inspection.

620
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,989
Your lockers should be
immaculate at all times

621
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,590
and ready for random inspection.

622
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,030
Cheers.

623
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,501
Troop! Troop!

624
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,989
- One!
- Good, let's keep those arms pinned in.

625
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,585
Move to the left in file. Left!

626
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,628
- Turn!
- One! Two, three, one!

627
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,349
Bend your bottom closer to that bench!

628
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,580
- Stand down!
- One!

629
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,030
Two! Three! One!

630
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,270
March!

631
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,902
March! March!

632
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,379
Hurry up!

633
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,541
Run, run, run!

634
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,183
One!

635
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,949
- One!
- Two, three, one!

636
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,229
All of you that pass out will be deployed

637
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,749
at some point in the future.

638
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,989
Which means, unfortunately,
some of you won't be coming home.

639
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:46,870
Take a look around at
the faces in this room.

640
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,909
Each and every one of you
will be missed terribly

641
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,020
by your people back home.

642
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,869
How anyone will miss some
of you pains in the back side

643
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,180
is hard to believe, I know.

644
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:01,789
But missed you will most certainly be

645
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:04,349
and that's why you are each tasked

646
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:08,662
to write a letter from the
grave for your families.

647
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,349
These are private and personal.

648
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:14,810
Hopefully, never to be opened.

649
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:18,670
Your Corporals can offer
assistance, if needed.

650
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,622
That's your call.

651
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:26,349
You have to play with your
left hand, that is the rule!

652
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,549
Hang on, I don't remember
anything about that rule.

653
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:30,789
- Well, if you want help with your ironing...
- No, no!

654
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,709
We don't need any help with our ironing.

655
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,309
Well, that shirt tells me you do.

656
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,669
This shirt is casual,
it's supposed to look...

657
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,103
What, like shit?

658
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,989
OK, OK. Let's have some
order and solemnity here.

659
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,185
Chris, left-handed, yeah?

660
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,749
Come on!

661
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,269
Referees decision is final.

662
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,549
Molly, if you lose, you're
ironing his kit tonight.

663
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,589
And Chris, if you lose,
you're bulling her boots. Yeah?

664
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:56,029
Yeah, and I want to see
my face in them, sunshine!

665
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,383
Go on, Molly!

666
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,469
Hang on a minute, you're
bloody left-handed!

667
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,585
No way!

668
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,120
She's here, she's here.

669
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,104
What?

670
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:48,909
Um... it's only one point for a recruit!

671
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:52,469
One point for a recruit,
five points for a corporal,

672
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:55,309
ten points for a sergeant,
and 50 for a major!

673
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,949
Well, I've just been down the
gym, putting a bit of extra...

674
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,429
Oh, yeah!

675
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:03,149
Well, we was down the stores watching
you collect one point from Chris Ingram's!

676
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,663
Yeah!

677
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,549
All this exercise is
making me double want it!

678
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:09,829
But what about your fella back home?

679
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,349
What fella? Besides, what goes on tour...

680
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,341
Goes on Facebook!

681
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:24,029
- Run! Run!
- Come on, girls, jump! Jump!

682
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,000
Come on! Come on, jump!

683
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:33,338
Lauren!

684
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,070
Lauren!

685
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:47,543
Lauren!

686
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,700
Lauren, Lauren.

687
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,290
Lauren, it's Molly!

688
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,149
Right, pull her legs up.
She's caught in the webbing.

689
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,749
Get the webbing off, get the webbing off.

690
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,069
Right, I've got her weight. Unclip her.

691
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,469
Lauren! She's not answering. Lauren!

692
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,228
- Lauren.
- Lauren.

693
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,390
Hold on.

694
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,669
Is she all right? Yeah, she's all right.

695
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,109
You're all right, Lauren.

696
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,540
Good work, Dawes.

697
00:48:24,725 --> 00:48:26,764
You know, my old man, he said to me,

698
00:48:26,765 --> 00:48:30,764
he said, You never forget
who you're on basic with.

699
00:48:30,765 --> 00:48:32,804
- Royal Engineer.
- Is he still in?

700
00:48:32,805 --> 00:48:34,844
Copped it four years ago.

701
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,358
Dead!

702
00:48:36,445 --> 00:48:39,039
I hope so, we buried him!

703
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:45,844
It was a... IED.

704
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:48,485
Died instantly.

705
00:48:48,565 --> 00:48:49,884
Oh, sorry.

706
00:48:51,605 --> 00:48:54,004
I know what he means about
never forgetting anyone.

707
00:48:54,005 --> 00:48:56,924
Your basic training, they
just try and break you down.

708
00:48:56,925 --> 00:49:00,084
They want you to forget
about everything outside

709
00:49:00,085 --> 00:49:02,564
and give yourself up to the Army.

710
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,476
It's like a cult.

711
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:07,604
They break you down to nothing,

712
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:09,960
make you a no-one.

713
00:49:10,045 --> 00:49:13,124
And they build you back
up how they want you built.

714
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:15,404
You know, like Frankenstein's monster.

715
00:49:15,405 --> 00:49:17,844
That way, they send you off to war

716
00:49:17,845 --> 00:49:20,524
and you'll do whatever they tell you to do.

717
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:24,040
Kill and not blink an eyelid.

718
00:49:28,285 --> 00:49:31,705
Not everyone's going to get through here.

719
00:49:32,205 --> 00:49:37,598
Them that can't be broken down
and rebuilt or are just too weak,

720
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:39,755
booted into touch.

721
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:45,435
If any of my section were under
threat, I'd take a bullet for them.

722
00:49:46,365 --> 00:49:49,095
Well, they got you already, then.

723
00:49:50,485 --> 00:49:52,684
Come on, girls, push it! Push it!

724
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:53,685
Faster.

725
00:49:55,405 --> 00:49:57,364
Keep pushing it, girls! Faster!

726
00:49:57,365 --> 00:49:58,844
Come on, girls!

727
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:01,484
Hurry up! Hurry up! Still got to get there!

728
00:50:01,485 --> 00:50:04,557
Keep going, girls! Come on, Katy!

729
00:50:04,645 --> 00:50:06,364
Come on! You're too far back, girl!

730
00:50:06,365 --> 00:50:08,276
Come on, keep going!

731
00:50:08,365 --> 00:50:09,718
Come on, Katy!

732
00:50:09,805 --> 00:50:12,080
In front, harder!

733
00:50:12,165 --> 00:50:14,195
Come on, you can do it!

734
00:50:14,205 --> 00:50:16,444
Keep pushing it, girls! Keep pushing it!

735
00:50:16,445 --> 00:50:19,084
If some of you show that little
effort when you're deployed,

736
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:23,604
the chances of you coming back in
one piece are pretty fucking remote!

737
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:25,561
Stand by your beds!

738
00:50:25,645 --> 00:50:29,718
06:00, kit and locker
inspection, tomorrow morning,

739
00:50:29,805 --> 00:50:32,685
breakfast. Then weapons safety test.

740
00:50:33,605 --> 00:50:35,835
If anybody fails,

741
00:50:35,925 --> 00:50:40,095
it's another eight-mile
endurance run, in full kit!

742
00:50:49,725 --> 00:50:55,561
Right. As you'll have noticed,
our numbers are down by two.

743
00:50:55,645 --> 00:50:57,684
UFAS. Tell them what that means,

744
00:50:57,685 --> 00:50:59,804
if you'll be so good, Corporal Geddings.

745
00:50:59,805 --> 00:51:01,715
Unfit For Army Service.

746
00:51:03,445 --> 00:51:06,724
Those people were
showing the wrong attitude

747
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:09,842
and were not fit for purpose.

748
00:51:09,925 --> 00:51:11,604
Chris Ingram's, Dawes.

749
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:13,245
Gone. And forgotten.

750
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:18,335
Do you want to join him or stay with us?

751
00:51:19,525 --> 00:51:21,004
Stay, Corporal.

752
00:51:21,085 --> 00:51:23,758
And Craig Garners gone.

753
00:51:23,845 --> 00:51:27,001
Troop!

754
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:29,394
Fall out!

755
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:31,564
The rest of you, get on the mini-bus.

756
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:33,764
And throughout this entire trip,

757
00:51:33,765 --> 00:51:38,415
try to remember you are

No, Corporal.

778
00:52:47,725 --> 00:52:49,444
You're up early, then.

779
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:50,795
It's the new me!

780
00:52:53,325 --> 00:52:55,524
Gagging for a brew, me. D'you fancy one?

781
00:52:55,525 --> 00:52:56,799
Is it allowed?

782
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:59,335
I'll bend the rules this once.

783
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,804
You must be knackered.

784
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,284
Yeah, well, we thought we'd
just take it easy today.

785
00:53:06,285 --> 00:53:10,324
Sleep in this morning, go to
the pictures this afternoon.

786
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:17,964
Are you enjoying it?

787
00:53:17,965 --> 00:53:20,524
I ain't jacking it in if
that's what you mean, Corp.

788
00:53:20,525 --> 00:53:22,004
I'm making the grade.

789
00:53:22,005 --> 00:53:24,364
I bet you were a right
treasure at school, weren't ya?

790
00:53:24,365 --> 00:53:28,735
Two of my teachers had
nervous breakdowns cos of me.

791
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:31,764
Take someone a lot bigger and
badder than you to break us.

792
00:53:31,765 --> 00:53:33,284
Aren't you trying to break me?

793
00:53:33,285 --> 00:53:34,718
No.

794
00:53:34,805 --> 00:53:37,797
We want you to be... a part of us.

795
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:39,884
Not the one on the outside trying to...

796
00:53:39,885 --> 00:53:42,335
Trying to be the class clown.

797
00:53:46,485 --> 00:53:50,084
After my basic training, we
were deployed out in Iraq.

798
00:53:50,085 --> 00:53:52,684
Our section commander
got preliminary orders

799
00:53:52,685 --> 00:53:55,564
that we were to secure a
building across from the compound.

800
00:53:55,565 --> 00:54:00,923
He was told possible enemy
direct fire and mine field.

801
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:04,884
He told the section and we all went fine.

802
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:07,081
Except one fella.

803
00:54:07,165 --> 00:54:11,364
And he was the one who was
always joking... our class clown.

804
00:54:11,365 --> 00:54:16,825
The one on the outside who thought
he was better than the system.

805
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,354
We ran across the area,

806
00:54:19,445 --> 00:54:21,959
he dithered, cacking himself.

807
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:27,705
Only one who got injured.
Dithered on a mine.

808
00:54:27,725 --> 00:54:30,105
Not a great place to dither.

809
00:54:31,285 --> 00:54:32,915
Lost both his legs.

810
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:37,123
What we do,

811
00:54:37,205 --> 00:54:39,855
we do to save your life, Molly.

812
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:44,025
You either leave or learn.

813
00:54:51,965 --> 00:54:55,095
Why did you get rid of Chris Ingram's?

814
00:54:57,205 --> 00:54:58,625
Why d'you think?

815
00:55:11,085 --> 00:55:12,085
Rise up!

816
00:55:12,165 --> 00:55:13,393
As you were.

817
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,825
One volunteer, please.

818
00:55:18,405 --> 00:55:20,680
As you're only texting...

819
00:55:20,765 --> 00:55:21,880
Come on.

820
00:55:27,045 --> 00:55:29,204
If that's bloody Jade
saying she can't cope...

821
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:31,400
- Who is it?
- It's Molls.

822
00:55:33,405 --> 00:55:35,284
Oh, they've been on an adventure trip.

823
00:55:35,285 --> 00:55:36,884
Yeah, on our taxes, no doubt?

824
00:55:36,885 --> 00:55:40,845
Well, you don't pay
taxes, so you're all right.

825
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:44,524
She's on to live ammunition now.

826
00:55:44,525 --> 00:55:46,338
It's our daughter, she's in the Forces.

827
00:55:46,339 --> 00:55:47,539
- Wow.
- Yeah.

828
00:55:47,685 --> 00:55:49,721
Oh, God!

829
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:54,680
- Just this way.
- Thank you.

830
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:56,644
He was always a scatter-brain.

831
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,244
Left lots of bits here.

832
00:55:58,245 --> 00:56:02,015
Nothing... valuable.
Just... we want them now.

833
00:56:34,205 --> 00:56:36,644
Exposure of the figure twelve target.

834
00:56:36,645 --> 00:56:39,524
Fire one five-round group at the target.

835
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:41,641
Rapid fire!

836
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:57,444
One, two, three. One, two, three, one...

837
00:57:13,645 --> 00:57:17,274
Who fancies a little bit of mouthwash?

838
00:57:17,365 --> 00:57:20,684
Sambuca! I've been saving
it for that special occasion!

839
00:57:21,965 --> 00:57:24,565
- You decent?
- Yes, Corporal!

840
00:57:25,725 --> 00:57:26,999
Rise up!

841
00:57:32,205 --> 00:57:34,639
Good evening, ladies.

842
00:57:34,725 --> 00:57:35,725
It's late.

843
00:57:40,965 --> 00:57:46,455
Thought you might be getting ready
for tomorrow mornings inspection!

844
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:53,364
Just about up to standard, Dawes.

845
00:57:53,365 --> 00:57:55,415
Why, thank you, Corporal.

846
00:57:56,725 --> 00:57:57,725
Ah...

847
00:57:59,645 --> 00:58:00,839
Mouthwash.

848
00:58:03,285 --> 00:58:05,795
Do you mind if I borrow this?

849
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:10,844
You seem to forget that I went
through basic training too!

850
00:58:10,845 --> 00:58:12,642
I know everything.

851
00:58:12,725 --> 00:58:16,044
Including what some people
get up to behind the stores.

852
00:58:29,245 --> 00:58:31,444
So is that your natural colour, then?

853
00:58:31,445 --> 00:58:33,163
Brown.

854
00:58:33,245 --> 00:58:34,564
Dark chestnut!

855
00:58:38,885 --> 00:58:41,204
- Good, Corporal.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

856
00:58:41,205 --> 00:58:45,444
One Section down to seven.
Three Section down to eight.

857
00:58:45,445 --> 00:58:47,924
Still at your full
compliment here, Corporal.

858
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:49,074
Just.

859
00:58:50,565 --> 00:58:51,604
Enjoy your leave.

860
00:58:51,605 --> 00:58:54,605
Don't spend your entire time pissed.

861
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,665
Keep up the fitness.

862
00:58:57,365 --> 00:58:58,644
I'll see you in a week.

863
00:58:58,645 --> 00:59:00,695
Thank you, Sergeant.

864
00:59:06,725 --> 00:59:09,684
Don't look too bloody smug just yet.

865
00:59:09,685 --> 00:59:12,675
Long way to go before you pass out.

866
00:59:16,365 --> 00:59:18,524
Right, let's get our civvies on!

867
00:59:23,485 --> 00:59:24,705
You all right?

868
00:59:25,685 --> 00:59:27,724
Come on, the mini bus is on the station.

869
00:59:27,725 --> 00:59:30,924
- You know what they're like, they won't wait.
- I'm not going home, Molls.

870
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:32,924
What you chatting about, you nut bar?

871
00:59:32,925 --> 00:59:35,803
I'm not going home, Molly.

872
00:59:35,885 --> 00:59:38,004
I've cleared it with the Corporal.

873
00:59:38,005 --> 00:59:40,644
They're going to give me light
duties around the barracks.

874
00:59:40,645 --> 00:59:42,324
Why aren't you going home?

875
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:45,764
They don't really want me back

876
00:59:45,765 --> 00:59:47,884
and, to be honest, that is fine with me.

877
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,644
Who don't? Your mum don't?

878
00:59:49,645 --> 00:59:51,625
Well, her new boyfriend.

879
00:59:53,445 --> 00:59:57,324
She said... well, she reckons
it might for be the best.

880
00:59:57,325 --> 00:59:59,004
In case it causes arguments.

881
00:59:59,005 --> 01:00:02,275
Which it would, so... this is me home.

882
01:00:04,885 --> 01:00:07,804
Right. Get your glad rags on, lady...

883
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:09,404
London Town, here we come.

884
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,324
You don't want me coming back with you.

885
01:00:11,325 --> 01:00:12,524
I just said I do.

886
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,284
Yeah, but you don't, so...

887
01:00:14,285 --> 01:00:16,265
I wouldn't bullshit you.

888
01:00:24,765 --> 01:00:27,284
Dawes! How you getting
on with your letter home?

889
01:00:27,285 --> 01:00:30,345
- I'm about to go see them.
- Write it!

890
01:00:37,525 --> 01:00:41,084
Left, right! Left, right!
Left, right! Left, right!

891
01:00:41,085 --> 01:00:43,724
We're going to have to do so
much drill when we get back.

892
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:45,764
Have you ever been abroad before?

893
01:00:45,765 --> 01:00:48,244
Oh, yeah, were quite
sophisticated in Lancashire!

894
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:48,994
I never have.

895
01:00:48,995 --> 01:00:51,460
- What, like not even in Spain?
- Not even Wales!

896
01:00:51,465 --> 01:00:56,075
The first time I step on a
plane, it'll be to Afghanistan.

897
01:01:02,805 --> 01:01:06,354
Oh! My big girls come home to mummy!

898
01:01:08,885 --> 01:01:11,124
Let's have a look at the little sproglet!

899
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,844
Oh, he looks like Dad, poor fella!

900
01:01:13,845 --> 01:01:17,284
- He don't, he looks like me, don't he, Mum?
- Well, he's got a bit of everybody in him.

901
01:01:17,285 --> 01:01:21,198
Look at you, Molls! Look at you!

902
01:01:21,285 --> 01:01:25,642
- What?
- I dunno. You look all...

903
01:01:25,725 --> 01:01:28,797
All... I dunno!

904
01:01:31,365 --> 01:01:34,524
- Oh, Mum, this is my mate, Katy! She's coming to stay.
- All right, Katy?

905
01:01:36,565 --> 01:01:38,476
We thought it was you!

906
01:01:38,565 --> 01:01:40,884
- Welcome home!
- What d'you mean, you thought it was me?

907
01:01:40,885 --> 01:01:44,324
We was on the bus and we thought we saw
you walking down the road with your friend.

908
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,364
Oh, my mate, Katy. Army. Top girl.

909
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:47,764
All right, Katy.

910
01:01:47,845 --> 01:01:50,484
So, we on a girlie night
out tonight or what?

911
01:01:50,485 --> 01:01:52,044
Yeah, sounds like a plan, Stan!

912
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:54,204
I'm all right, thanks, Mar.
I'm off them as it goes.

913
01:01:54,205 --> 01:01:56,435
- Molly!
- Molly!

914
01:01:56,525 --> 01:01:57,719
Hello!

915
01:01:57,805 --> 01:02:00,444
Oh, here she is!

916
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:03,724
I can't believe your hair!

917
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:05,844
Dye it again, you look too different!

918
01:02:05,845 --> 01:02:09,084
I been dying it since I was 11, I
thought it was about time I went natural!

919
01:02:09,085 --> 01:02:11,724
Look at your hands, Molly.
They gone like cuttle fish!

920
01:02:11,725 --> 01:02:14,124
Don't go near my budgie,
he'd fucking eat them!

921
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:16,284
And where's them beautiful nails!?

922
01:02:16,285 --> 01:02:18,560
Not... regulation.

923
01:02:18,645 --> 01:02:20,364
When did you start taking orders?

924
01:02:20,365 --> 01:02:24,677
Are we going to get
ruined tonight or what?!

925
01:02:24,765 --> 01:02:29,204
Get in there, get in there,
get in there, get in there.

926
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:31,036
Three, two, one!

927
01:02:42,685 --> 01:02:46,025
I been at work. Shower. Then come here.

928
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:47,524
How did you know I was here?

929
01:02:47,525 --> 01:02:48,745
Your dad said.

930
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:50,680
Artan!

931
01:02:52,965 --> 01:02:54,665
There you go, fella.

932
01:02:59,165 --> 01:03:00,764
What's going on there?

933
01:03:00,765 --> 01:03:02,604
Your dad knew I wanted to see you.

934
01:03:02,605 --> 01:03:05,324
- He hates you.
- Have you missed me?

935
01:03:05,325 --> 01:03:06,644
You didn't ring.

936
01:03:06,645 --> 01:03:08,124
It's tricky.

937
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:10,164
This is my friend, from training.

938
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:11,962
Hi.

939
01:03:12,045 --> 01:03:13,755
Were getting married.

940
01:03:18,285 --> 01:03:19,354
Let's talk.

941
01:03:26,005 --> 01:03:27,204
Don't go back.

942
01:03:27,205 --> 01:03:30,124
I don't really want to leave
Katy on her own for too long.

943
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:33,084
Don't go back to training.
You know what I mean.

944
01:03:33,085 --> 01:03:34,200
I want to.

945
01:03:34,285 --> 01:03:35,684
I don't want you to.

946
01:03:35,685 --> 01:03:36,924
Oh, don't you?!

947
01:03:36,925 --> 01:03:39,884
Molly, I know I haven't
always loved you well...

948
01:03:39,885 --> 01:03:42,564
What, you mean shagging other people?

949
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:44,805
I always come back to you.

950
01:03:45,685 --> 01:03:47,105
You are my love.

951
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:50,238
You are my heart.

952
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:51,675
Is that a fact?

953
01:03:54,445 --> 01:03:56,844
I have to marry you because you are me.

954
01:03:56,845 --> 01:03:59,295
What the fuck does that mean?

955
01:04:00,405 --> 01:04:02,873
Without you... I am not me.

956
01:04:04,485 --> 01:04:08,876
I am someone else, someone less.

957
01:04:08,965 --> 01:04:11,160
With you, baby, I am man.

958
01:04:13,885 --> 01:04:15,034
I am proud.

959
01:04:19,845 --> 01:04:22,445
- It's happened already, yes?
- What?

960
01:04:23,885 --> 01:04:25,844
They're training you to hate us.

961
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:27,605
Don't be a dickhead.

962
01:04:32,445 --> 01:04:33,860
Will you fucking stop doing that?!

963
01:04:33,861 --> 01:04:35,361
- What?
- Always grabbing my face!

964
01:04:35,365 --> 01:04:37,964
- You don't get to touch my face anymore!
- Why not?

965
01:04:37,965 --> 01:04:39,115
Just go away.

966
01:04:48,925 --> 01:04:51,204
- What's going on?
- What do you mean, what's going on?

967
01:04:51,205 --> 01:04:54,324
He's been bang up for you coming home
and you're treating him like shit.

968
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:57,764
- What's going on with you?!
- I said I'd make sure things were smooth between you.

969
01:04:57,765 --> 01:05:00,066
- What's it gotta do with you?
- We're helping each other out and that.

970
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:01,067
Oh, shut up!

971
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:03,444
Molly, go back inside and be nice.

972
01:05:03,445 --> 01:05:05,164
Show him a bit of respect.

973
01:05:05,165 --> 01:05:07,284
What is all this shit about respect?!

974
01:05:07,285 --> 01:05:10,924
Why don't you go in there and you
treat him with a bit of respect?!

975
01:05:10,925 --> 01:05:14,615
You don't talk to me
like that, understand?!

976
01:05:16,805 --> 01:05:18,324
He's doing me a favour.

977
01:05:18,325 --> 01:05:20,156
Oh, God! What?

978
01:05:20,245 --> 01:05:21,382
What's it gotta do with you?

979
01:05:21,383 --> 01:05:23,540
Well, obviously quite a lot
if he's doing you a favour

980
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:24,844
and I'm part of the deal.

981
01:05:24,845 --> 01:05:26,284
You're going to marry him anyway,

982
01:05:26,285 --> 01:05:28,028
what difference does it make if
he thinks I'm the one allowing it?

983
01:05:28,029 --> 01:05:29,313
Allowing it?

984
01:05:29,605 --> 01:05:31,284
You what? You butt out, love, yeah?

985
01:05:31,285 --> 01:05:33,204
So you're my pimp now, Dad, is that right?

986
01:05:33,205 --> 01:05:35,604
Just fucking marry him, Molly. For Daddy.

987
01:05:35,605 --> 01:05:37,736
You know, that's exactly what
were fighting for in Afghanistan.

988
01:05:37,737 --> 01:05:38,737
What?

989
01:05:38,925 --> 01:05:42,404
So that women can have a say in who they
marry or if they want to get married at all.

990
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,521
What a load of bullshit!

991
01:05:44,605 --> 01:05:49,964
Were out there fighting to show the
ragheads were no fucking pushover.

992
01:05:49,965 --> 01:05:52,644
Look, Molls, we've come
up with a way to make us...

993
01:05:52,645 --> 01:05:54,524
Well, not rich, but sorted.

994
01:05:54,525 --> 01:05:56,435
- You and Artan?
- Exactly.

995
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:00,564
They've taken me off the
sick, I'm back on Job Seekers.

996
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:02,764
I can't afford to feed the family any more.

997
01:06:02,765 --> 01:06:05,905
Imagine how that makes me feel, Moll.

998
01:06:08,205 --> 01:06:10,644
I've got a start with a Russian
firm building on Aldgate.

999
01:06:10,645 --> 01:06:12,444
Artan's got a cousin working there.

1000
01:06:12,445 --> 01:06:14,084
Now, if I can persuade you to marry him,

1001
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:18,515
his cousins going to put
a nail gun through my hand.

1002
01:06:18,525 --> 01:06:21,764
I mean, brilliant or what?
Now, say you'll marry him.

1003
01:06:21,765 --> 01:06:23,884
Fucking hell, Dad, has
the booze finally done

1004
01:06:23,885 --> 01:06:25,964
your last brain cell
in!? You're off your nut!

1005
01:06:25,965 --> 01:06:27,404
That's how much you know, then.

1006
01:06:27,405 --> 01:06:29,644
I'll get a huge wedge
compensation from the Russians

1007
01:06:29,645 --> 01:06:31,084
and I'll be on the sick for life.

1008
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:33,684
We've thought it all through
and all you've got to do...

1009
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:35,164
And if you don't...

1010
01:06:35,165 --> 01:06:36,684
if you don't, Moll,

1011
01:06:36,685 --> 01:06:39,604
there'll be very serious
repercussions for the whole family!

1012
01:06:39,605 --> 01:06:41,575
Yeah, you want that, eh?

1013
01:06:44,605 --> 01:06:48,044
I promise you, you won't
see any of us again.

1014
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:50,804
Not your mum, not your
bothers or your sisters.

1015
01:06:50,805 --> 01:06:52,324
- That's a fact.
- Fine.

1016
01:06:52,325 --> 01:06:54,964
You don't want to see
me, fine. I'll see Mum.

1017
01:06:54,965 --> 01:06:57,284
Oh, no, you won't, she's 100% behind me

1018
01:06:57,285 --> 01:06:58,604
because she's a proper wife.

1019
01:06:58,605 --> 01:06:59,924
Like you're going to be.

1020
01:06:59,925 --> 01:07:02,280
I mean, you join the Army,

1021
01:07:02,365 --> 01:07:04,724
you're happy to get your
head blown off for England,

1022
01:07:04,725 --> 01:07:10,595
you're saying you won't do a simple
thing for your own flesh and blood?

1023
01:07:33,325 --> 01:07:35,025
- Ready?
- When you are.

1024
01:07:47,205 --> 01:07:50,204
- Just going to fuck off, then, yeah?
- Without saying nothing.

1025
01:07:50,205 --> 01:07:51,564
It ain't like that.

1026
01:07:51,565 --> 01:07:54,644
Don't give it like you're anything
special! You're in the Army!

1027
01:07:54,645 --> 01:07:57,804
Anyone can join the fucking Army.
They let her in for starters!

1028
01:07:58,925 --> 01:08:01,204
Yeah. We ain't good enough for you no more.

1029
01:08:01,205 --> 01:08:05,645
Wrong, bitch! You're not
good enough for us anymore!

1030
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,644
Come on, Mar, let's go.

1031
01:08:09,205 --> 01:08:10,274
Loser!

1032
01:08:10,365 --> 01:08:13,004
There's things I know and there's
things you don't know I know.

1033
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:15,644
- Yeah? What's that supposed to mean?
- I'll put it this way.

1034
01:08:15,645 --> 01:08:18,644
Once upon a time, I'd have knocked
your teeth down your throat.

1035
01:08:18,645 --> 01:08:22,125
But why should I make you better looking?

1036
01:08:26,085 --> 01:08:27,279
Come on!

1037
01:08:34,805 --> 01:08:36,324
One, two, three!

1038
01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:37,955
Two, one, two!

1039
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,196
- Guess what?
- Go on.

1040
01:08:47,525 --> 01:08:48,594
This lot...

1041
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:54,605
... needs sorting and
putting in the stores.

1042
01:08:56,805 --> 01:08:58,444
Sorry, guys. Another few bits.

1043
01:08:58,445 --> 01:09:00,764
Do you want us to unload
that trolley, Corp?

1044
01:09:00,765 --> 01:09:03,064
These are previously enjoyed. They'll
need going through the laundry first.

1045
01:09:03,065 --> 01:09:05,364
Then ironed, ladies.

1046
01:09:05,365 --> 01:09:08,684
And there was me thinking we'd
go into town for a Ruby later.

1047
01:09:08,685 --> 01:09:10,844
Right, I'll take that below and do it.

1048
01:09:10,845 --> 01:09:13,375
You keep stacking, Molly Dawes.

1049
01:09:20,565 --> 01:09:22,844
Stop looking at me. I know I look a mess.

1050
01:09:22,845 --> 01:09:25,244
You look a lot better than
when you first arrived!

1051
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:26,360
You flirting?

1052
01:09:26,445 --> 01:09:29,564
I've got a duty of care. Flirting verboten.

1053
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,195
I won't say nothing.

1054
01:09:33,485 --> 01:09:36,765
Here, pass us them boxes, please, Corp.

1055
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:41,124
But I do understand it must be
hard for you to control yourself

1056
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:43,644
- when you're around me, Dawes.
- Oh! Dream on, Corp.

1057
01:09:43,645 --> 01:09:47,084
As it happens, it's pretty obvious
that you're proper loved up with me.

1058
01:09:48,325 --> 01:09:49,724
How d'you work that one out, then?

1059
01:09:49,725 --> 01:09:51,684
You UFAS-ing Chris Ingram's.

1060
01:09:51,685 --> 01:09:55,635
What, you reckon that
was down to you and him?

1061
01:09:56,445 --> 01:10:00,444
Can I tell you that was absolutely
nothing to do with you and him?

1062
01:10:00,445 --> 01:10:02,644
He was a good soldier, you know that.

1063
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:05,876
You're joking. His attitude stank.

1064
01:10:05,965 --> 01:10:09,004
And all that crap that he was
saying in the canteen was not on.

1065
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:11,924
How do you know what he was
saying to me in the canteen?

1066
01:10:11,925 --> 01:10:15,564
All that about brain
washing and like were a cult.

1067
01:10:15,565 --> 01:10:20,135
He thought he was cleverer
than the system. No-one is.

1068
01:10:20,325 --> 01:10:23,445
So he was right, it is like a cult.

1069
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:26,955
It's a family.

1070
01:10:30,925 --> 01:10:32,765
You write that letter?

1071
01:10:35,085 --> 01:10:36,200
Dawes?

1072
01:10:37,605 --> 01:10:39,725
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Stand easy.

1073
01:10:40,765 --> 01:10:42,444
Bit of bad news, I'm afraid.

1074
01:10:42,445 --> 01:10:44,804
Your fathers had an accident at work.

1075
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:46,324
They've taken him to hospital,

1076
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,644
but your mother informs
me he's going to be fine.

1077
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:51,004
- Sergeant...
- If it's all right with you, Corporal,

1078
01:10:51,005 --> 01:10:53,364
I think we can excuse Dawes
the Realities Of War tour

1079
01:10:53,365 --> 01:10:57,084
- and she can have a few days compassionate.
- Fine.

1080
01:10:57,085 --> 01:10:58,725
Excuse me, Sergeant.

1081
01:11:00,365 --> 01:11:03,644
I want to go on the
trip, please. Thank you.

1082
01:11:03,645 --> 01:11:07,004
Nine different regiments
stood shoulder to shoulder

1083
01:11:07,005 --> 01:11:09,004
to fend off the German advance.

1084
01:11:09,005 --> 01:11:12,284
They knew that had the
Germans broken through,

1085
01:11:12,285 --> 01:11:15,924
the allied position would
have been nigh on impossible.

1086
01:11:15,925 --> 01:11:17,964
And life in the trenches...

1087
01:11:17,965 --> 01:11:22,444
often up to your thighs in
foul, rancid, rat-infested water.

1088
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:23,924
And these rats were huge,

1089
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:27,244
they had so much waste and
dead human flesh to feast on.

1090
01:11:27,245 --> 01:11:29,164
And then, there was the mustard gas,

1091
01:11:29,165 --> 01:11:32,044
which caused great
mustard-coloured blisters.

1092
01:11:32,045 --> 01:11:34,084
Your eyes would be glued shut.

1093
01:11:34,085 --> 01:11:35,844
The gas would attack the lungs,

1094
01:11:35,845 --> 01:11:38,404
making every breath an agonising fight

1095
01:11:38,405 --> 01:11:42,724
until after four of five weeks, the
poison would eventually kill you,

1096
01:11:42,725 --> 01:11:46,415
giving the rats even
more carrion to devour.

1097
01:11:48,285 --> 01:11:51,804
Every one of these graves tells us a story,

1098
01:11:51,805 --> 01:11:54,244
not just of some brave Tommy,

1099
01:11:54,245 --> 01:11:57,317
but of a brother, a father, a son

1100
01:11:57,405 --> 01:12:01,225
who died doing what they
saw was their duty...

1101
01:12:01,285 --> 01:12:03,605
their service to the nation.

1102
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:06,564
<i>In Flanders fields
The poppies blow.</i>

1103
01:12:06,565 --> 01:12:10,683
<i>Between the crosses, row on row.</i>

1104
01:12:10,765 --> 01:12:13,882
<i>That mark our place.</i>

1105
01:12:13,965 --> 01:12:15,603
<i>And in the sky.</i>

1106
01:12:15,685 --> 01:12:19,314
<i>The larks, still bravely singing
Fly.</i>

1107
01:12:19,405 --> 01:12:22,795
<i>Scarce heard amid the guns below.</i>

1108
01:12:24,525 --> 01:12:25,875
<i>We are the dead.</i>

1109
01:12:27,405 --> 01:12:28,963
<i>Scarce days ago.</i>

1110
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:33,004
<i>We lived, felt dawn
Saw sunset glow.</i>

1111
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:38,243
<i>Loved and were loved.</i>

1112
01:12:38,325 --> 01:12:40,441
<i>And now we lie.</i>

1113
01:12:40,525 --> 01:12:42,083
<i>In Flanders fields.</i>

1114
01:12:45,525 --> 01:12:48,358
<i>Take up our quarrel with the foe:</i>

1115
01:12:48,445 --> 01:12:52,154
<i>To you from failing hands we throw.</i>

1116
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:56,796
<i>The torch, be yours to hold it high.</i>

1117
01:12:58,245 --> 01:13:00,764
<i>If ye break faith with us who die.</i>

1118
01:13:00,765 --> 01:13:02,325
<i>We shall not sleep.</i>

1119
01:13:03,565 --> 01:13:07,364
<i>Though poppies grow.</i>

1120
01:13:07,365 --> 01:13:09,321
<i>In Flanders fields.</i>

1121
01:13:34,485 --> 01:13:35,713
Who was that?

1122
01:13:35,805 --> 01:13:39,084
Oh, it's my sister. I
didn't feel like chatting.

1123
01:13:39,085 --> 01:13:40,803
Mum, it's only me.

1124
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:45,915
I just wanted to hear your voice.

1125
01:13:47,885 --> 01:13:49,444
D'you want a cup of tea?

1126
01:13:49,445 --> 01:13:51,004
If that was Molly, she's been told.

1127
01:13:51,005 --> 01:13:53,444
- We don't want nothing to do with her no more.
- Yeah, I know.

1128
01:13:53,445 --> 01:13:54,917
If she ever rings, you put
the phone straight down, yeah?

1129
01:13:54,918 --> 01:13:55,918
Yes.

1130
01:13:59,365 --> 01:14:02,845
Have nothing to do with the selfish mare.

1131
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:12,135
And I just wanted you
to know that I love you.

1132
01:14:35,245 --> 01:14:38,924
You will come to passing
out, wont you, Mum?

1133
01:14:38,925 --> 01:14:41,803
Please try, it's a big deal.

1134
01:14:42,965 --> 01:14:44,159
It's important.

1135
01:15:43,365 --> 01:15:45,321
Turn!

1136
01:15:45,405 --> 01:15:47,202
General salute!

1137
01:15:47,285 --> 01:15:50,322
Present arms!

1138
01:15:52,365 --> 01:15:56,724
Devastating blast by just one
man wearing a suicide belt.

1139
01:15:56,725 --> 01:16:00,524
Al-Qaedas weapon of choice.
Undetected by security...

1140
01:16:00,525 --> 01:16:03,404
This is Private Dawes, she's
joining the Royal Army Medical Corps.

1141
01:16:03,405 --> 01:16:05,284
Private Dawes, good morning. How are you?

1142
01:16:05,285 --> 01:16:07,884
- Very well, sir.
- And all the very best. Welcome to the RAMC.

1143
01:16:07,885 --> 01:16:10,065
- Thank you, sir.
- Well done.

1144
01:16:54,645 --> 01:16:57,084
Not out celebrating with your family?

1145
01:16:57,085 --> 01:16:58,884
Can I stay here tonight?

1146
01:16:58,885 --> 01:17:00,364
I start at Keogh tomorrow.

1147
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:02,004
Exactly, so don't you want to... ?

1148
01:17:02,005 --> 01:17:05,884
I know what every second
would be like till the morning.

1149
01:17:05,885 --> 01:17:08,604
I got my next lot of recruits
coming in tomorrow morning.

1150
01:17:08,605 --> 01:17:10,484
Does your duty of care prevent you

1151
01:17:10,485 --> 01:17:14,855
from necking a bottle of
warm flat lemonade with me?

1152
01:17:15,405 --> 01:17:18,204
I think I'll be able to square
that with the Ministry of Defence.

1153
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:28,922
I feel strange.

1154
01:17:29,005 --> 01:17:32,839
You'll do fine. First
impressions, remember.

1155
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:34,764
No gobbing off on day one.

1156
01:17:34,765 --> 01:17:36,118
Me?

1157
01:17:39,565 --> 01:17:43,045
Six months corps and then the real thing.

1158
01:17:43,885 --> 01:17:45,524
Can you drink in Afghanistan?

1159
01:17:45,525 --> 01:17:46,525
No chance.

1160
01:17:48,645 --> 01:17:51,025
I just wanted to say thanks.

1161
01:17:55,005 --> 01:17:56,985
I'm a soldier, Corporal!

1162
01:17:58,525 --> 01:18:00,163
Only fucking just.

1163
01:18:31,725 --> 01:18:33,284
Ah, I thought you might be hiding.

1164
01:18:33,285 --> 01:18:37,364
I'm not hiding, I'm just...
getting my stuff together and that.

1165
01:18:37,365 --> 01:18:40,645
My Aunties driving me up to Birmingham.

1166
01:18:44,205 --> 01:18:48,323
- Oh! Look after yourself, Katy.
- I will.

1167
01:18:48,405 --> 01:18:49,844
Keep in touch, OK?

1168
01:18:49,845 --> 01:18:53,964
Rumour has it, you can go on
Facebook at Keogh, so... watch out!

1169
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,484
We only bleeding done it!

1170
01:19:00,845 --> 01:19:05,077
The next 14 weeks, I
am your mother, father,

1171
01:19:05,165 --> 01:19:10,080
boyfriend, grandma and your
bloody God all rolled into one.

1172
01:19:10,165 --> 01:19:12,156
You are mine,

1173
01:19:12,245 --> 01:19:16,716
and, more importantly, I am yours.

1174
01:19:16,805 --> 01:19:19,844
The next weeks are going to
need your absolute concentration

1175
01:19:19,845 --> 01:19:22,313
and dedication.

1176
01:19:22,405 --> 01:19:25,244
Those determined enough will pass out.

1177
01:19:25,245 --> 01:19:27,724
Those that dig deeper than
they ever thought they could

1178
01:19:27,725 --> 01:19:30,284
and find new strengths, will pass through.

1179
01:19:30,285 --> 01:19:35,364
Those that do not give up in the
face of adversity will do all right.

1180
01:19:35,365 --> 01:19:38,721
You want it enough, you will get it.

1181
01:19:38,805 --> 01:19:40,435
I promise you that.

1182
01:19:44,165 --> 01:19:47,084
Hello, Zero. This is Charlie Two One.

1183
01:19:47,085 --> 01:19:48,677
Contact! Wait out!

1184
01:19:48,765 --> 01:19:51,837
Help! Please help!

1185
01:19:51,925 --> 01:19:53,643
Help! Help!

1186
01:19:57,645 --> 01:19:59,840
Keep still, Private.

1187
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:02,284
Keep still. Good lad. Lie still as you can.

1188
01:20:02,285 --> 01:20:04,044
I'm going to get you out of here, OK?

1189
01:20:06,325 --> 01:20:09,484
Keep looking at me. I'm going
to get you out of here, OK?

1190
01:20:09,485 --> 01:20:11,404
I'll be right back, you understand?

1191
01:20:11,405 --> 01:20:12,844
How you doing, Corporal?

1192
01:20:12,845 --> 01:20:14,563
I've lost my foot.

1193
01:20:14,645 --> 01:20:17,484
I know you're my section commander,
but right now, I'm in charge,

1194
01:20:17,485 --> 01:20:20,604
I need you to man up. All right, man up!

1195
01:20:20,605 --> 01:20:24,404
See, what did I tell you?
I'm right back. Hello, Zero.

1196
01:20:24,405 --> 01:20:28,005
This is Charlie Two One. One T1 to one T2.

1197
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:31,638
Insurgents!

1198
01:20:36,525 --> 01:20:38,964
Right, I need to get you back to the Jeep.

1199
01:20:56,205 --> 01:20:57,524
Good work, Private.

1200
01:20:57,525 --> 01:20:58,844
Thanks, Sarge.

1201
01:20:58,925 --> 01:21:01,484
So, why d'you pick the Private?

1202
01:21:01,485 --> 01:21:03,884
Well, he lost both legs,
was losing a lot of blood.

1203
01:21:03,885 --> 01:21:06,324
The other lad lost a foot,
but he was fully conscious.

1204
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:07,844
I had to make a decision quickly.

1205
01:21:07,845 --> 01:21:09,924
Thanks, lads. Go and
get yourselves some scoff

1206
01:21:09,925 --> 01:21:13,164
and pick up your Oscars
once you've eaten, yeah?

1207
01:21:13,165 --> 01:21:15,884
You know, you don't just go
to who screams the loudest.

1208
01:21:15,885 --> 01:21:18,124
No, Sarge. I wanted to
tourniquet the Private

1209
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:21,164
- before I jumped on the Corporal.
- What about me?

1210
01:21:21,165 --> 01:21:25,955
Took full impact of the blast,
assessed unable to survive.

1211
01:21:27,645 --> 01:21:30,044
No, seriously, when you
was screaming your nut off,

1212
01:21:30,045 --> 01:21:32,524
I thought something had
really happened! Private Dawes!

1213
01:21:32,525 --> 01:21:35,865
You got a visitor, down the guard room.

1214
01:21:43,205 --> 01:21:44,763
Mum!

1215
01:21:44,845 --> 01:21:46,844
What's the matter? What's happened?

1216
01:21:46,845 --> 01:21:48,520
- Nothing.
- Well, what you doing here, then?

1217
01:21:48,521 --> 01:21:49,521
Oh, charming.

1218
01:21:49,525 --> 01:21:51,604
I don't mean it like that, it's just...

1219
01:21:51,605 --> 01:21:55,695
I wanted to see you.
That's all right, isn't it?

1220
01:21:58,845 --> 01:22:00,844
- How did you get here?
- Train.

1221
01:22:00,845 --> 01:22:03,225
Why didn't you let me know?!

1222
01:22:05,925 --> 01:22:08,105
Does Dad know you're here?

1223
01:22:09,405 --> 01:22:10,440
No.

1224
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,444
Where does he think you are?

1225
01:22:12,445 --> 01:22:15,684
Taking the baby up the hospital
for his six-month check.

1226
01:22:15,685 --> 01:22:18,405
We were there all day last time!

1227
01:22:30,685 --> 01:22:31,905
You look well.

1228
01:22:32,725 --> 01:22:33,919
Knackered.

1229
01:22:34,005 --> 01:22:35,204
They working you hard?

1230
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:38,545
Well, you know, there's a lot to learn.

1231
01:22:39,725 --> 01:22:41,225
That phone call...

1232
01:22:42,445 --> 01:22:44,975
What phone call? Can't remember.

1233
01:22:45,525 --> 01:22:47,564
I had to see you, Molly.

1234
01:22:47,565 --> 01:22:51,935
Can't remember a phone call.
I must have been pissed.

1235
01:22:53,845 --> 01:22:56,365
You never come to passing out.

1236
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:59,995
It was difficult with your dad.

1237
01:23:00,685 --> 01:23:02,403
Does he hate me?

1238
01:23:02,485 --> 01:23:04,595
Cor, he loves you, Molly.

1239
01:23:11,325 --> 01:23:12,885
And how's the baby?

1240
01:23:13,685 --> 01:23:16,044
As big a pain in the arse
as the rest of us six?

1241
01:23:16,045 --> 01:23:19,535
Yeah, carrying on a fine family tradition!

1242
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:27,305
We all look out for each other here, Mum.

1243
01:23:28,325 --> 01:23:31,404
I had to see you, Molly.
I had to touch you.

1244
01:23:31,405 --> 01:23:35,415
Don't set me off, Mum.
You know what I'm like.

1245
01:23:38,445 --> 01:23:40,065
Do you have to go?

1246
01:23:41,525 --> 01:23:42,735
I want to go.

1247
01:23:45,845 --> 01:23:46,960
Oh, God!

1248
01:23:55,765 --> 01:23:58,444
God, it was weird climbing those steps.

1249
01:23:58,445 --> 01:24:01,724
When we knew we'd be stepping
out into a different world.

1250
01:24:01,725 --> 01:24:03,841
All that training, Mum.

1251
01:24:03,925 --> 01:24:06,883
All those months making me... me.

1252
01:24:06,965 --> 01:24:10,975
And this was it, this
was what it was all for.

1253
01:24:11,565 --> 01:24:15,375
I was proud to sit with
each and every soul.

1254
01:24:18,565 --> 01:24:19,600
Good people.

1255
01:24:28,365 --> 01:24:32,044
Every time I'm out on patrol,
I think of you back home.

1256
01:24:32,045 --> 01:24:34,724
Back home seems a long way away right now,

1257
01:24:34,725 --> 01:24:39,905
but it's never been so crisp
and clear and perfect in my mind.

1258
01:24:40,405 --> 01:24:44,204
If I listen carefully, I can
hear the kids playing, laughing.

1259
01:24:44,205 --> 01:24:46,044
Like when you put a shell to your ear

1260
01:24:46,045 --> 01:24:47,804
and you think you can hear the sea.

1261
01:24:47,805 --> 01:24:52,225
Maybe you do! Cos I can
hear all you lot right now.

1262
01:24:52,685 --> 01:24:56,645
Tell the kids I love
them. The little bleeders.

1263
01:24:58,245 --> 01:25:01,724
I love being out on
patrol. I love Afghanistan.

1264
01:25:01,725 --> 01:25:05,877
The sounds, the smells,
the heat on my skin.

1265
01:25:06,965 --> 01:25:09,484
Nothing worries me anymore, Mum,

1266
01:25:09,485 --> 01:25:11,115
I've got it sorted.

1267
01:25:17,005 --> 01:25:21,445
Anyway, if you're reading
this, it means they got me.

1268
01:25:24,525 --> 01:25:27,564
They get us to write these
letters from the grave.

1269
01:25:27,565 --> 01:25:31,084
Seems mad to think that I
won't ever see you again.

1270
01:25:31,085 --> 01:25:32,804
I didn't want to write,

1271
01:25:32,805 --> 01:25:36,924
but my Corporal said there'd be
a Molly-sized hole in your heart

1272
01:25:36,925 --> 01:25:38,345
if I was killed.

1273
01:25:39,725 --> 01:25:42,604
I don't want a hole in your heart, Mum.

1274
01:25:42,605 --> 01:25:46,955
Your heart is way too good
to have any hole in it.

1275
01:25:48,365 --> 01:25:52,153
Anyway, let's hope I died gallantly.

1276
01:25:52,245 --> 01:25:55,124
Let's hope they've
spooned me into a body bag

1277
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:57,455
after doing something heroic.

1278
01:25:59,005 --> 01:26:00,884
It's funny to think that the thing

1279
01:26:00,885 --> 01:26:04,244
that made me into some
sort of decent human being

1280
01:26:04,245 --> 01:26:06,415
has been the death of me.

1281
01:26:07,725 --> 01:26:10,244
But, it's better this way, isn't it?

1282
01:26:10,245 --> 01:26:12,440
Does that make any sense?

1283
01:26:12,525 --> 01:26:16,284
It is better to have done
something, been someone,

1284
01:26:16,285 --> 01:26:19,524
have my name read out by
the Prime Minister, isn't it?

1285
01:26:19,525 --> 01:26:22,884
Soldiers killed in Afghanistan...

1286
01:26:22,885 --> 01:26:24,762
I love you, Mum.

1287
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:32,844
Tell Dad I love him, too.

1288
01:26:32,845 --> 01:26:34,884
Our girl will be all right.

1289
01:26:34,885 --> 01:26:39,764
Serving in the Helmand Province
have been withdrawn until next year.

1290
01:26:39,765 --> 01:26:42,684
The Prime Minister came here to
tell the British troops himself

1291
01:26:42,685 --> 01:26:44,395
that within months...

1292
01:26:49,305 --> 01:26:51,624
The war in Afghanistan is coming to an end,

1293
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:54,943
but after 11 years of
conflict, at what price?

1294
